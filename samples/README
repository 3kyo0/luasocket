This directory  contains some  sample programs using  LuaSocket as
well  as the  automatic tests  used to  make sure  the library  is
working properly.

The files provided are:

	testsrvr.lua			-- test server
	testclnt.lua			-- test client
	testcmd.lua				-- test command definitions

To run  the automatic tests on  your system, make sure  to compile
the library with _DEBUG defined (check makefile) and then open two
terminals.  Run  'luasocket  testsrvr.lua'  on  one  of  them  and
'luasocket testclnt.lua'  on the other. The  programs should start
talking to each other.

	listener.lua			-- echo server
	talker.lua				-- echo tester

listener.lua and  talker.lua are  about the  simplest applications
you  can write  using  LuaSocket. Run  'luasocket listen.lua'  and
'luasocket talk.lua' on different  terminals. Whatever you type on
talk.lua will be printed by listen.lua.

	dict.lua				-- dict client

The dict.lua module is a cool simple client for the DICT protocol,
written by Luiz  Henrique Figueiredo. Just run it and  enter a few
words to see it working.

Good luck,
Diego.
