<!-- whatis +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

<h2 id=whatis>What is LuaSocket?</h2>

<p>
LuaSocket  is a  <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a>  extension library
that is composed by two parts: a C layer that provides  support for the TCP
and UDP transport layers, and a set of Lua modules that add support for
the SMTP (sending  e-mails),  HTTP  (WWW access)  and  FTP  (uploading  and
downloading files) protocols. 
</p>

<p>
Network support has been  implemented so that it  is both efficient and
simple to use.  LuaSocket can be used by any Lua application once it has
been properly linked with and initialized by the interpreter running the
Lua application.  The code has been tested and runs well on several Windows
and Unix platforms. 
</p>

<p>
The library is available under the same  
<a href="http://www.lua.org/copyright.html">
terms and conditions</a> as the Lua language, the MIT license. The idea is
that if you can use Lua in a project, you should also be able to use 
LuaSocket.

<!-- download +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

<h2 id=download>Download</h2>

<p>
LuaSocket version  2.0 alpha is now  available for download! It  is
compatible with   Lua&nbsp;5.0   and   has    been   tested   on
Windows&nbsp;XP, Linux, and Mac OS X. 
</p>

<p>
The library can be downloaded in source code from the following links: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="luasocket-2.0-alpha.tar.gz">luasocket-2.0-alpha.tar.gz</a> <br>
<a href="luasocket-2.0-alpha.zip">luasocket-2.0-alpha.zip</a>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Besides the full C and Lua source code for the library, the distribution
contains several examples, this user's manual and the test procedures.
</p>

<p>
I  am also  providing  a Windows  binary  for those  that  want to  give
LuaSocket a quick try: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="luasocket-2.0.exe">luasocket-2.0.exe</a>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This  binary has been compiled  with the <tt>LUASOCKET_DEBUG</tt>
option, and  should be able to run the automatic test procedures.
</p>

<!-- whatsnew +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

<h2 id=new>What's New</h2>

<p>
Most of  the changes for  2.0 happened in the C layer, which
has been almost completely rewritten. The code has been ported to Lua 5.0
and greatly improved.  There have also been some API changes
that made  the interface simpler and  more consistent. Here are  some of
the changes that made it into version 2.0: 
</p>

<ul>
<li> Major C code rewrite. Code is modular and extensible. Hopefully, next
     versions will include code for local domain sockets, file descriptors,
     pipes (on Unix) and named pipes (on windows) as a bonus;

<li> Following the Lua 5.0 trend, all functions provided by the library are
     in the namespace <tt>socket</tt>.  Functions such as
     send/receive/timeout/close etc do not exist anymore as stand-alone
     functions. They are now only available as methods of the appropriate
     objects;

<li> All functions return a non-nil value as first return value if successful.
     All functions return whatever could be retrieved followed by error message
     in case of error. The best way to check for errors is to check for the
     presence of an error message;  

<li> UDP connected   sockets can break association with peer by calling
     <tt>setpeername</tt> with address '<tt>*</tt>';

<li> TCP has been changed to become more uniform.  First create an object,
     then connect or bind if needed, and finally use I/O functions. The
     <tt>socket.connect</tt> and <tt>socket.bind</tt> functions are still
     provided for simplicity, but they just call <tt>socket.tcp</tt> followed 
     by the <tt>connect</tt> or <tt>bind</tt> methods;

<li> Better error messages and parameter checking;

<li> <tt>socket.sleep</tt> and <tt>socket.time</tt> are now part of the
     library and are supported. They used to be available only when
     LUASOCKET_DEBUG was defined, but it turns out they might be useful for
     applications;

<li> Socket options interface has been improved and TCP objects also 
     support socket options.

</ul>

<!-- incompatible +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

<h3 id=incompatible>Incompatibilities with previous versions</h3>

<ul>
<li> The introduction of namespaces affects all programs that use LuaSocket,
specially code that relies on global functions. These are no longer
available. Note that even the support modules (<tt>http</tt>, <tt>smtp</tt>
etc) have been moved to the namespace (i.e.  <tt>socket.http</tt>,
<tt>socket.smtp</tt> etc);

<li> WARNING: The new <tt>send</tt>,
<tt>sendto</tt>, <tt>setpeername</tt> and <tt>setsockname</tt>, 
<tt>ftp.put</tt>, <tt>ftp.put_cb</tt> return convention WILL break old code; 

<li> Interface to options has changed;

<li> <tt>socket.select</tt> refuses tables that have anything that is not
an object from the group <tt>select{able}</tt>. This includes even the
'<tt>n</tt>' field. Silently ignoring objects was a source of bugs for Lua
programs.
</ul>

<!-- old ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

<h2 id=old>Old Versions</h2>

<p>
All  previous versions  of the  LuaSocket library  can be  downloaded 
<a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/luasocket/old">here</a>. Although
these  versions are  no longer  supported, they  are still available for
those that have compatibility issues.
