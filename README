This release is work in progress. It has been tested on WinXP, Mac OS X,
SunOS and Linux. The most important change is a major rewrite of the C code
that attempts to make the library extensible. Also, all functions were
moved to the 'socket' namespace. A few changes are expected for the final
version, mostly in order to make the API more uniform.

In this version, all Lua code has been built into the binary. For that, you
will need a working versions of luac and bin2c, both available with your
Lua distribution. Check makefile for details.

Have fun,
Diego Nehab.
