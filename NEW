All functions provided by the library are in the namespace "socket".
Functions such as send/receive/timeout/close etc do not exist in the
namespace. They are now only available as methods of the appropriate
objects.

Object has been changed to become more uniform.  First create an object for
a given domain/family and protocol. Then connect or bind if needed. Then
use IO functions.

All functions return a non-nil value as first return value if successful.
All functions return nil followed by error message in case of error.
WARNING: The send function was affected.

Better error messages and parameter checking.

UDP connected udp sockets can break association with peer by calling
setpeername with address "*". 

socket.sleep and socket.time are now part of the library and are 
supported.
