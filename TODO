- merge luaL_typeerror into auxiliar to avoid using luaL prefix? 
- getsockname should also support IPv6, no?
- remove RCSID from files?
- shouldn't we instead make the code compatible to Lua 5.2
  without any compat stuff, and use a compatibility layer to
  make it work on 5.1?
- why 2.1.1 rather than 2.1?
- add what's new to manual
- should there be an equivalent to tohostname for IPv6?
- should we add service name resolution as well to
  getaddrinfo?
- document bind and connect behavior based on address?

- add functionality to query if object is ipv4 or 6?
- update copyright date everywhere? 
- what to do about author? 
- add http POST sample to manual
  people keep asking stupid questions
- documentation of dirty/getfd/setfd is problematic because of portability
  same for unix and serial.
  what to do about this? add a stronger disclaimer?
- remove references to Lua 5.0 from documentation, add 5.2?
- update lua and luasocket version in samples in documentation
- document headers.lua?
- fix makefile with decent defaults?

Done:

- document ipv5_v6only default option being set?
- document tcp6 and udp6
- document dns.getaddrinfo 
- document zero-sized send on udp vs. tcp?
  no.
- document unix socket and serial socket? add raw support?
  no.
- document getoption

ftp send should return server replies?
make sure there are no object files in the distribution tarball
http handling of 100-continue, see DB patch
DB ftp.lua bug.
test unix.c to return just a function and works with require"unix"
get rid of setmetatable(, nil) since packages don't need this anymore in 5.1
compat-5.1 novo
ajeitar pra lua-5.1

adicionar exemplos de expansão: pipe, local, named pipe
